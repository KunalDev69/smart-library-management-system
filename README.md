## 🧾 Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** Traditional library systems rely on manual book tracking, paper registers, and lack real-time features like automated fine calculation, overdue reminders, and digital book discovery. This leads to inefficiency, lost records, and poor user experience.

**Our Solution:** SLMS is a web-based library management system that digitizes the complete library workflow — from book cataloging to issuing, returning, fine management, and analytics. It also introduces smart features like AI-powered book recommendations, QR code scanning, automated waitlists, and reading analytics dashboards.

**Key Highlights:**
- 🔐 Secure authentication with email OTP verification and JWT tokens
- 📚 Complete book lifecycle management (add → borrow → return → review)
- 🤖 AI-powered hybrid recommendation engine (content-based + collaborative filtering)
- 📱 QR code generation for every book + camera-based QR scanning for instant returns
- ⭐ Community-driven review and rating system
- 🔔 Automated waitlist with 24-hour claim window and email notifications
- 📊 Rich reading analytics with heatmaps, charts, streaks, and stat dashboards
- ⏰ Background cron jobs for overdue reminders, unverified account cleanup, and waitlist processing
- 🛡️ Enterprise-grade security: CSRF protection, rate limiting, HTTP-only cookies, password hashing

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 1. Authentication & Authorization
- User registration with **6-digit email OTP verification** (10-minute expiry)
- **JWT-based** login with HTTP-only cookies (`SameSite=strict`)
- Forgot password → email reset link with **15-minute expiry** (SHA-256 hashed token)
- Role-based access control: **Admin** and **Member**
- Automatic deletion of unverified accounts after 24 hours (cron job)
- Session persistence via `GET /api/auth/me` on app load

### 📚 2. Book Management (Admin)
- Add books with **cover image upload via Cloudinary**
- Edit and delete book records
- **QR code auto-generated** for every book on creation (stored as base64 data URL)
- Regenerate QR codes on demand
- Search books by **title, author, or category** (case-insensitive regex)
- Server-side **pagination** with configurable page size
- Track book availability status (auto-updated on borrow/return)

### 📖 3. Borrowing & Return System
- Issue books to members with a **14-day lending period**
- Return books with **automatic fine calculation** (₹5 per overdue day)
- **QR code-based returns** — scan the book's QR code with your camera for instant return
- Prevent duplicate borrows (can't borrow the same book twice simultaneously)
- **Email confirmations** sent on both borrow and return
- Admin can view **all borrow records** across the system
- Members can view their **personal borrow history**
- Admin can view **overdue records** with current fine amounts

### 👥 4. User Management (Admin)
- View all registered users with details
- **Promote** a member to admin or **demote** admin to member
- Delete user accounts
- View individual user profiles

### 📧 5. Email Notifications (6 Types)
| Email | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| OTP Verification | User registers a new account |
| Password Reset Link | User requests "Forgot Password" |
| Borrow Confirmation | Book is successfully issued to a member |
| Return Confirmation | Book is returned (includes fine details if any) |
| Overdue Reminder | Daily cron at 9 AM for all overdue books |
| Waitlist Notification | A waitlisted book becomes available |

All emails use **branded HTML templates** with styled layouts.

### 🤖 6. AI-Powered Book Recommendations
- **Hybrid recommendation engine** combining content-based and collaborative filtering
- Scoring formula with weighted factors:
  - **Category match: 40%** — books in the member's favourite categories
  - **Popularity: 30%** — based on average rating
  - **Recency: 15%** — recently added books get a boost
  - **Author match: 15%** — books by authors the member has read before
  - **Collaborative bonus: +15%** — books borrowed by users with similar reading patterns
- Falls back to **popular books globally** for new users with no borrow history
- Returns **top 10 personalized recommendations**
- Displayed as a "Recommended For You" carousel on the Member Dashboard

### ⭐ 7. Book Reviews & Community Ratings
- Members can leave a **1–5 star rating** with an optional text comment (max 500 chars)
- **One review per user per book** (enforced with a unique database index)
- **Review gating**: only users who have borrowed AND returned a book can review it
- Average rating and review count are **denormalized on the Book document** for fast reads
- Star ratings displayed on **every BookCard** in the catalog and on the **Book Detail** page
- `can-review` API endpoint lets the frontend check eligibility before showing the review form

### 🔔 8. Book Waitlist & Auto-Assignment
- Members can **join a position-tracked queue** for unavailable books
- Joining is blocked when the book is already available (direct borrow instead)
- Duplicate waitlist entries prevented (unique index on `book + user`)
- When a book is returned, the **next person in line is automatically notified via email**
- Notified member gets a **24-hour claim window** to borrow the book
- If the window expires, the slot **auto-advances to the next person** (hourly cron job)
- Members can **leave the waitlist** at any time (positions auto-reorder)
- View queue position from the Book Detail page or My Books page

### 📊 9. Reading Analytics Dashboard
- **Total stats**: books borrowed, returned, currently active, total fines paid
- **On-time return rate** (percentage)
- **Reading streak** — consecutive months with at least one book returned
- **Monthly bar chart** — books read per month over the last 12 months (Recharts)
- **Category pie chart** — distribution of books by genre/category
- **365-day reading heatmap** — GitHub-style calendar showing daily borrow counts
- **Top authors** — most-read authors list
- **Recent activity timeline** — last 5 borrow/return events

### 🖥️ 10. Admin Dashboard & Reports
- **Admin summary**: total books, available books, total borrows, active borrows, overdue count
- **Average rating** across all books in the system
- **Top 5 most borrowed books** with borrow counts
- Total reviews count
- Manage Books, Manage Users, Borrow Records, and Reports pages

## 🤖 AI Recommendation Engine

The system uses a **hybrid recommendation algorithm** that combines:

1. **Content-Based Filtering** — analyzes the member's borrow history to find their favourite categories and authors
2. **Collaborative Filtering** — finds users with similar reading patterns and recommends what they've read

### Scoring Formula
```
Score = (CategoryBonus × 0.40) + (PopularityScore × 0.30) + (RecencyScore × 0.15) + (AuthorBonus × 0.15) + (CollaborativeBonus × 0.15)
```

| Factor | Weight | Logic |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Category Match** | 40% | Book's category matches user's most-read categories |
| **Popularity** | 30% | Based on the book's average star rating (0–5 normalized) |
| **Recency** | 15% | Recently added books get a time-decay boost |
| **Author Match** | 15% | Book's author matches authors the user has read before |
| **Collaborative** | +15% | Books borrowed by users who share ≥2 common books |

**New User Fallback:** If a user has no borrow history, the engine returns the top-rated, most-reviewed books globally.

---

## 💰 Fine Calculation Logic

```
Overdue Days = ceil((Actual Return Date − Due Date) / 86,400,000 ms)
Fine = max(0, Overdue Days) × ₹5
```

- **Rate**: ₹5 per day overdue
- **Rounding**: Days are rounded **up** (Math.ceil) — even 1 hour late = 1 day fine
- **Trigger**: Fine is calculated at the moment of return
- **Display**: Fine amount is shown on the return confirmation screen and included in the return email
- **No fine**: If returned on or before the due date, fine = ₹0

---

## ⏰ Background Cron Jobs

Three automated background tasks run on schedules:

| Cron Job | Schedule | What It Does |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Overdue Reminders** | Daily at 9:00 AM | Finds all currently borrowed books past their due date, calculates the current fine for each, and sends an email reminder to the borrower |
| **Unverified Account Cleanup** | Daily at 12:00 AM (midnight) | Deletes user accounts that remain `verified: false` for more than 24 hours, preventing database clutter from abandoned registrations |
| **Waitlist Processor** | Every hour at :00 | Checks for waitlist entries in `notified` status whose 24-hour claim window has expired, marks them as `expired`, reorders remaining positions, and notifies the next person in line |

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

| Requirement | How to Get It |
|------------|---------------|
| **Node.js v18+** | Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **npm** (comes with Node.js) | Installed automatically with Node.js |
| **MongoDB Atlas account** | Free at [mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) |
| **Gmail account with App Password** | See Gmail App Password Setup below |
| **Cloudinary account** | Free at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) |

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunalDev69/smart-library-management-system.git
cd smart-library-management-system
```

### Step 2 — Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

This installs all 14 backend dependencies listed in `package.json`.

### Step 3 — Create Backend Environment File

Create a file at `backend/config/config.env` and fill in your credentials:

```env
# Server
PORT=4000

# MongoDB Atlas connection string
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/slms

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here_make_it_long_and_random
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
COOKIE_EXPIRE=7

# Gmail SMTP (for sending emails)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SERVICE=gmail
SMTP_MAIL=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password

# Cloudinary (for book cover image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Step 4 — Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

This installs all 12 frontend dependencies.

The frontend is pre-configured to call the backend at `http://localhost:4000/api` via the Axios instance in `src/utils/api.js`.

### Step 5 — Setting Up External Services

#### MongoDB Atlas (Database)
1. Go to [mongodb.com/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) → Create a free cluster
2. Create a database user with a username and password
3. Whitelist your IP address (or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development)
4. Click "Connect" → "Connect your application" → Copy the connection string
5. Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` in `MONGO_URI`

#### Gmail App Password (Email)
1. Go to [myaccount.google.com](https://myaccount.google.com/) → Security
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** (required)
3. Go to **App passwords** (search for it in Google Account settings)
4. Select app: "Mail", device: "Other" → Name it "SLMS"
5. Copy the 16-character password → Use as `SMTP_PASSWORD`

#### Cloudinary (Image Upload)
1. Go to [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) → Sign up (free)
2. From the Dashboard, copy:
   - Cloud Name → `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
   - API Key → `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
   - API Secret → `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## ▶️ Running the Project

### Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
✅ Backend starts at: **http://localhost:4000**
You should see:
```
Server is running on port 4000
MongoDB Connected: <cluster-name>
```

### Start Frontend Dev Server
Open a **new terminal** and run:
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
✅ Frontend starts at: **http://localhost:5173**

### Access the Application
Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

### Creating an Admin Account
1. Register a new account through the app (you'll receive an OTP email)
2. Verify the OTP
3. Go to **MongoDB Atlas** → Browse Collections → `users` collection
4. Find your user document and change `"role": "member"` to `"role": "admin"`
5. Refresh the app — you'll now see the Admin Dashboard

| **Input Validation** | Email validation via `validator`, password minimum length, field limits |
| **NoSQL Injection Prevention** | QR code return uses string type check to prevent object injection |
| **Token Expiry** | JWT: 7 days, OTP: 10 minutes, Password reset: 15 minutes |
| **Unverified Cleanup** | Auto-delete unverified accounts after 24 hours |
